1 - Using create-react-app, what do we need to set up for testing?

    create-react-app comes with jest library, so you can start creating your test without care about installing or configuring anything.
2 - What components are worth to test in your development?
    In my option components that have side effects should be tested.
    For tesing, I mean that a component gets some input and that input changes the output of behaivor. it must be tested.
    For example a component that only renders jsx/html, I don't think we need to test it.

3 - Can you apply TDD once you already created components?
    Talking about TDD, its better to create a failing test first, then build the necessary code (we can say create the component) to make the test pass and the second step is to refactor the code.
    When you build the component first, it's possible that tests are not covering all the scenarios because the component is already working and some test cases might be missing.
